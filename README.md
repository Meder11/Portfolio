To ensure functionality and security, I rigorously test my code with comprehensive testing frameworks and follow secure coding practices like input validation and regular security audits.

I interpret user needs by actively listening, gathering requirements, and maintaining clear communication throughout development to ensure the program meets user expectations.

When designing software, I use a systematic approach, breaking down requirements into modular components, applying design patterns like SOLID, and iterating based on feedback to create scalable and maintainable solutions.
